# 📊 Garbage Classification - Week 2 Report

## 🎯 Week 2 Focus
This week focused on evaluating model performance and gaining insight into class-level accuracy and error patterns.

---

## 🔧 Key Improvements

### 1️⃣ Test Set Creation
- Split the validation set into two equal halves:
  - One used for validation during training
  - The other used as a separate test set

### 2️⃣ Evaluation Metrics
- Generated a confusion matrix 🧩 using seaborn and matplotlib
- Generated a classification report 📝 using sklearn.metrics showing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class

### 3️⃣ Training History Visualization
- Plotted training vs validation accuracy and loss 📈
- Helped detect overfitting or underfitting trends

---

## ✅ Outcome
The added evaluation tools gave deeper insight into model behavior. They helped identify which classes need more attention and paved the way for fine-tuning and interpretability improvements in the final week.
